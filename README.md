# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

Credit risk is a challenging situation that most individuals or corporate borrowers will encounter when providing or seeking funds for a specific purpose. A credit risk is the possibility that a borrower will fail to repay a loan or make the required payments agreed to in a contract. A lender having taken the risk to provide a loan does not receive the owed principal and interest thus resulting in cash flow disruption or related costs.

In this project we will be using a data set and taking on the credit risk challenge specifically as it relates to credit card risk. We will be preparing the data, using statistical reasoning and employing machine learning to solve this challenge as it relates to our reality today.

We have identified credit card risk as an unbalanced classification problem, many loans will be provided and serviced properly, however, a small number of loand will be considered risky. Because of this, we will use different techniques to deploy machine learning to train and then evaluate these models with unbalanced classes. Specifically we will be using the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once you’re done, you’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Overall Summary
- There is a summary of the results

- There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a 
justification

- Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
